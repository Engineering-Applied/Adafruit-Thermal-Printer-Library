## ////Raspberry Pi LIBRARY LOCATION////
On your Linux box: (home directory)/pico/<_Insert New Folder_>/            
*I used Printer_Test as my folder name for example*

_Due to my pico folder being on an external SSD my setup looks slightly different_

_Also added the STASH folder for any extraneous files such as .zip_
